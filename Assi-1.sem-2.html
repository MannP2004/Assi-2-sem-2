                Me, drink from me, drink from me (oh I-)
                Shoot across the symphony <mark>(oh I-, oh I-)</mark>
                That we shoot across the sky
                Drink from me, drink from me<mark>(I-, oh I-, oh I-)</mark>
                That we shoot across the <mark>(I'm feeling drunk and high)</mark>

                <mark>That we shoot across the s- (drink from)</mark>
                Oh, angel sent from up above
                You know you make my world light up
                When I was down, when I was hurt
                <mark>You came to lift me up</mark>
                Life is a drink and love's a drug
                Oh, now I think I must be miles up
                When I was a river, dried up
                <mark>You came to rain a flood</mark>
                You said, "Drink from me, drink from me"
                When I was so thirsty
                Pour on a symphony
                <mark>Now I just can't get enough</mark>
                Put your wings on me, wings on me
                When I was so heavy
                Pour on a symphony
                <mark>When I'm low, low, low, low
                I-, oh I-, oh I-
                Got me feeling drunk and high
                So high (so high), so high (so high)
                Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
                Now I'm feeling drunk and high
                So high (so high), so high (so high)
                (Woo)</mark>
                (Ooh)
                Oh, angel sent from up above
                I feel you coursing through my blood
                Life is a drink, your love's about
                <mark>To make the stars come out</mark>
                Put your wings on me, wings on me
                When I was so heavy
                Pour on a symphony
                <mark>When I'm low, low, low, low
                I-, oh I-, oh I-
                Got me feeling drunk and high

                La, la, la, la, la, la, la
                So high, so high
                I-, oh I-, oh I-
                Now I'm feeling drunk and high
                So high (so high), so high (so high)
                That we shoot across the sky
